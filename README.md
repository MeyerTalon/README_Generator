# README_Generator

## Description
This project was created to streamline the creation of a README.md file. By running the index.js file using the command node index.js in the Develop folder a series of prompts will appear. Answering these prompts will result in the generation of a high-quality README.md in the Develop folder. This project was also used to practice using Node.js and the inquirer package.
